      <h2>Why I Admire Him</h2>
      <p>
        Dr. A.P.J. Abdul Kalam was an extraordinary scientist and the 11th President of India. 
        He inspired millions through his vision, humility, and dedication to the nation.
        He came from a humble background and rose to become one of Indiaâ€™s most respected figures.
      </p>

      <p>
        What I adore most about him is his love for students and education. He always believed 
        that youth have the power to shape the future of a nation. He emphasized hard work, 
        dreaming big, and staying humble.
      </p>

      <p>
        His famous quote, <em>"Dream, dream, dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action."</em> 
        continues to inspire me every day.
